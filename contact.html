Others can come from just creative thinking. These can be the wyrm or most elemental dragons. There are others that come from rumours. These can include the dragonnet.</span></p>

                <p class="tstyle">Dragons come in many different shapes and sizes. They all get their own form and from their form they get a name. This name can be based off their physical features. Or they can be based off something completely different like words that would describe them in different languages such as quetzalcoatl. They can be named off their height like how some are named after how small they are. They can be named off where they were found as well.</p>
